# Hey there! 👋 I'm Max ⚡️

![Will Smith Eating Spaghetti](https://media.tenor.com/ZjJu5GKktKAAAAAM/will-smith-eating-spaghetti.gif)

🎓 **Master’s Student** at ETH Zurich, specializing in **Machine Intelligence** with a minor in **Data Management Systems**. I’m super passionate about **Data Science**, **AI**, and solving real-world problems with code. 🚀

💻 When I’m not buried in research papers or code, you’ll probably find me at a **hackathon**—always on the lookout for motivated, curious, and caffeinated teammates! ☕️

Feel free to check out my repositories or hit me up if you're up for a challenge or an idea! I'm always down for collaboration. 🤝

### 🔥 Fun facts:
- I'm a big advocate of **Zazen (meditation)** 🧘‍♂️, keeping that mind sharp!
- I’m known for yapping half of the time and coding the other. 😄
